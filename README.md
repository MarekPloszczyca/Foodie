## Foodie

"Foodie" is a restaurant website where customers can learn more about his favorite place. The website contains several subpages that allow user i.a. browse through restaurant's menu or reserve a table. When it comes to booking, site is saving correctly completed form informations in Local Storage and user can't reserve more using the same name to imitate real connection with restaurant database. The main reason to build this website was to consolidate knowledge about Tailwind CSS and it's core concepts. <br/><br/>
